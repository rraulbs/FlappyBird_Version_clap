This is an example by p5play library modified that allow to play with claps or any other noises.

The idea is to develop a game library with this simple resource. A disabled person or person with reduced mobility will be able to play without a joystick. You just have to whisper or make some noise to perform an action in the game.

Example:
1)Enable your microphone

2)You can play now making noise or mouse click or x to flap
